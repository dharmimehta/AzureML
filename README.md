# AzureML
A guide to complete Azure Machine Learning life cycle. 
This repository showcases a simplified example of an Azure Machine Learning workflow, modeled after production pipelines I develop as part of the Visualization R&D team at a healthcare company specializing in surgical devices for ophthalmology.

Our systems assist in treating complex eye diseases such as cataracts and glaucoma. In my role, I focus on building and automating ML workflows that support real-time surgical decision-making and image-guided visualization.

Note: This is a minimal, de-identified example for demonstration purposes only. Proprietary models, datasets, and configurations used in production are not shared here due to confidentiality.
